    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <h3>Technology Made Accessible. Success Made Sustainable.</h3>
    <p>
      Murel ICT (Pty) Ltd was founded with one mission: to empower underserved enterprises with access to powerful,
      professionally built digital solutions — without the financial hurdles that typically block innovation.
    </p>

    <p>
      We specialize in software and app development for SMMEs in the tech 
      and e-commerce sectors. But unlike traditional development firms, we don’t stop at delivery. We’re deeply invested in the long-term success of our clients through operational support and strategic advisory tailored for growing businesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our team consists of industry veterans, commercial advisors, 
      and technical experts who bring decades of combined experience to every solution we deliver.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Values</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Affordability</strong> – We build first, you only pay for hosting</li>
      <li><strong>Partnership</strong> – Your growth is our goal</li>
      <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> – Solutions that are easy to use, scale, and maintain</li>
      <li><strong>Support</strong> – Dedicated advisors beyond launch</li>
    </ul>

    <p>From your first idea to your first thousand users — we're with you every step of the way.</p>
